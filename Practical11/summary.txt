the alignment score:
human-mouse:1091
human-random:-250
mouse-random:-250
the percentage of identical amino acids for each comparison.
human-mouse:89.69%
human-random:5.83%
mouse-random:6.28%
Interpretation:
The alignment score and identical percentage between human and mouse are very
high and it shows there is a high degree of genetic similarity. That is 
because they are all mammals and their evolutional origin is the same.
However, the alignment score and identical percentage between random sequence
and human or mouse are low. The negative scores show their relationship is 
biological far away. It shows their degree of genetic similarity is low.
They have different evolutional origins. The random sequence may be taken from
nonmammalian organism.
