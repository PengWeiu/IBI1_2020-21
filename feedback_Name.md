In week4 practical, I didn't make change in the code.
In week5 practical, I didn't make change in the code. The feedback shows that there was an error:'Indentation error:unexpected indent'. But in my computer, it shows that there didn't have this problem. Thus, I asked the professor and he told me that I can ignore the problem.
In week6 practical, I made three changes.
1. I changed labels and sizes of the plot from input specific numbers to input the keys and values of the dictionary 'coronavirus_infection'. So we can change the plot as long as we change the dictionary. 
2. I added a commmand 'plt.title('coronavirus infection rate in different countries')' to give a title of the plot.
3. I changed 'notch' in 'plt.boxplot' from 'True' to 'False'.
