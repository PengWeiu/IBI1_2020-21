the difficult thing is that the connection between server and Github was so poor that I spent a lot of time solving this problem. It wasted me a lot of time. The chanllenging thing is that I was not familiar with Git command and I usually for got use add and commit command. Sometimes I needed to do steps again and again. The question I want to ask is that what is the difference between pull and clone when fetch the file from Github.
